  - ðŸ‘€ **Section 2: Non-Verbal Cues** - Exercises to recognize facial expressions, tone, and body language.
  - ðŸŽ¤ **Section 3: Voice Practice** - Audio-based activities to improve clarity, tone, and pacing.
  - ðŸ§  **Section 4: Progress Evaluation** - Combined speaking and text-based tasks to apply learned skills in realistic settings.

- **AI-Powered Assessment**: Onboarding assessment analyzed by Gemini AI to build personalized learning paths.

- **Feedback System**: Voice and facial emotion recognition to provide deeply personalized feedback.

- **Expert Appointment System**: Book sessions with communication experts through an integrated calendar system that automatically generates Google Meet links for both parties.

- **AI Conversation Practice**: Practice conversations with AI that simulates different social roles (teacher, friend, colleague) to help users learn appropriate communication styles for various contexts.
